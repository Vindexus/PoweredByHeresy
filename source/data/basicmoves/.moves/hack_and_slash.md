# Hack and Slash
When you **attack an enemy in melee**, roll+{{stat 'ws'}}. On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to roll an extra damage die but expose yourself to the enemyâ€™s attack. On a 7-9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.
