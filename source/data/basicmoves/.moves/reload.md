# Reload
When you **take a moment to reload your weapon** reset your weapon's uses and expend 1 ammo.

Once a character has expended all the uses of their weapon they need to reload. This isn't assumed, the players have to explicitly say they take a moment to reload. How long it takes is up to the GM, and reloading certainly counts as a prime opportunity for a GM move.
