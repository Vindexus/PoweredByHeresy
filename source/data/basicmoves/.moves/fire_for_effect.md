# Fire for Effect
When you <strong>fire your ranged weapon to deal damage</strong>, roll+{{stat 'bs'}} and expend a use of your weapon. On a 10+ deal your damage. At your option you may expend another use of your weapon to add +1d4 damage. On a 7-9 you deal your damage and choose one:
 - You take what you can get, deal -1d6 damage
 - You need to take some more shots, expend another use of your weapon
 - You have to place yourself or a teammate in danger, the GM will tell you how

>{{fire_for_effect.name}} is your go-to move when a character is shooting to kill. It covers drawing, cocking, aiming, and shooting your weapon. Firing your weapon doesn't mean squeezing off a single shot, it means shooting for a few seconds. That can mean a single shot, or a whole flurry of them. Either way, it's a single use of the weapon. Leave the exact number of shots to the fiction and let the uses dictate when they run low.  
>If you're using a weapon that doesn't have enough uses you can't take the bonus damage on the 10+ or the "expend another use" option on a 7-9.
