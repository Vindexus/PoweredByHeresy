# Defy Danger
When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it

 - by using martial arts, +{{stat 'ws'}}
 - by using a gun, +{{stat 'bs'}}
 - by powering through, +{{stat 'str'}}
 - by getting out of the way or acting fast, +{{stat 'ag'}}
 - by enduring, +{{stat 't'}}
 - with quick thinking, +{{stat 'int'}}
 - using charm and social grace, +{{stat 'fel'}}
 - through mental fortitude, +{{stat 'wp'}}
 - noticing something, +{{stat 'per'}}

On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear. On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.
