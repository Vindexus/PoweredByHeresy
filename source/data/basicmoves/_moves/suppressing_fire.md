# Suppressing Fire
When you **fire a weapon at one or more targets to suppress them**, roll+{{stat 'bs'}} and expend 1 use of your weapon. On a hit the target's morale is tested: they might dive for cover, falter, or attempt to flee. Your allies gain {{term 'forward' '+1'}} against them. On a 10+ you also deal your damage.

If you're shooting at the enemy for almost any effect other than to hit something, you're likely using suppressing fire. You might still land a few shots, but what you're trying to do is keep heads down so your allies can take advantage.
