# Discern Realities
When you closely study a situation or person, roll+Wis. On a 10+, ask the GM 3 questions from the list below. On a 7–9, ask 1.

Either way, take +1 forward when acting on the answers.

 - What happened here recently?
 - What is about to happen?
 - What should I be on the lookout for?
 - What here is useful or valuable to me?
 - Who’s really in control here?
 - What here is not what it appears to be?
