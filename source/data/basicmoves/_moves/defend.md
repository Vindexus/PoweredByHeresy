# Defend
When you **stand in defense of a person, item, or location** under attack, roll+{{stat 't'}}. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7â€“9, hold 1. So long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:
 - Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself
 - Halve the attack's effect or wounds inflicted
 - Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally {{term 'forward' '+1'}} against the attacker
