# Throw Grenade
When you **prime and throw a grenade**, roll+{{stat 'str'}}. On a 10+, the grenade lands where you aimed. On a 7-9 choose one:

 - The grenade lands where you aimed but you have to move to make the throw placing you or someone else in danger as described by the GM
 - The grenade only lands near where you aimed, for a reduced or unexpected effect as described by the GM

Pulling out a grenade and chucking it can all be done in one motion, but only if you have a grenade on hand. As a GM, the 7-9 results give you a lot of opportunity for interesting hard moves, don't be afraid to use them. A wily cultist might see an Acolyte fumbling for a grenade as a perfect opportunity to charge them. A grenade might fall short and deal half damage, or it might catch an ally in its blast. Explosives can also change the landscape of the battlefield by creating firewalls, caving in walls, making craters, or destroying cover.
