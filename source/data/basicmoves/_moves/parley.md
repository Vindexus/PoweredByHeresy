# Parley
When you have leverage on a GM Character and manipulate them, roll+{{stat 'fel'}}. Leverage is something they need or want. On a 10+, they do what you ask if you first promise what they ask of you. On a 7â€“9, they will do what you ask, but need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now.
