# Tactical Advantage
Each battle is different and requires a different approach. At the start of each battle, decide which tactic you are actively employing.

 - Defensive: As long as you don't attempt to gain ground, you gain +1 to all {{move defy_danger}} rolls
 - Reactive: Whenever you are attacked, you can immediately respond and take +1 forward
 - Reckless: You deal an extra damage die, but your defense is reduced by 1
 - Precise: While you remain focused on a single target, you inflict +1 wounds when you damage them

If you change tactics you lose the benefit of the one you had chosen.
