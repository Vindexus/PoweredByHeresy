# Lifting the Fog
The fog of war can mask any battle. As you witness it unfold, **whenever you or someone you have a bond with takes damage** gain 1 {{tactician.resource}} (Max 2). During the battle you may spend 1 {{tactician.resource}} to:

 - Add +1 to one of your rolls before your roll
 - Reroll a damage roll (yours or an ally's)

At the end of the battle your {{tactician.resource}} resets to 0.
