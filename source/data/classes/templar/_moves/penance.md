# Penance
When you **quickly perform penance**, you suffer 1 wound and gain 1 {{templar.resource}}. Penance is self punishment, such as tightening a cilice, using a whip or knout, or other forms of mortification of the ï¬‚esh. This type of brutal penance might be painful, but it's the only way to purify your soul quickly, such as in the midst of a battle.
