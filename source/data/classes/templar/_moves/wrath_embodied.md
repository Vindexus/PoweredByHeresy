# Wrath Embodied
You are the Emperor's vengeance made manifest and {{templay.resource}} is your currency. The more pure your soul, the more holy power can pass through you. If your soul is immaculate, then you have 3 {{templar.resource}} (the max).  
When you **spend time performing your purifcation ritual** (an uninterrupted hour or so), set your {{templar.resource}} to the max.
