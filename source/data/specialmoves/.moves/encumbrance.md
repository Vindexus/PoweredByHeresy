# Encumbrance
When you make a move while carrying weight you may be encumbered. If your weight carried is:

 - Equal to or less than your load, you suffer no penalty
 - Less than or equal to your load+2, you take -1 ongoing until you lighten your burden
 - Greater than your load+2, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll at -1, or automatically fail
