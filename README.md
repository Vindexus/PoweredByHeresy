# What is Powered by Heresy?
PbH is a tabletop role-playing game set in the [Warhammer 40,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000) universe. Players play as Acolytes of an Inquisitor, uncovering heresy in the Imperium of Man and eradicating it. It uses the [Powered by the Apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_by_the_Apocalypse) and draws heavily from [Dungeon World](http://dungeon-world.com) and [Dark Heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Heresy_(role-playing_game)).
