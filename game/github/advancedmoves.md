The following moves are available to all acolytes to take when they level up.

### <a class="anchor-from-text" id="rapid-reload"></a>Rapid Reload

When you attempt to reload quickly roll+Ag. On a 10+ you reload your weapon instantly - reset its uses and reduce your ammo by one. On a 7-9 the same in addition to what that the GM says. On a 6- you fumble your reload.

### <a class="anchor-from-text" id="spout-forbidden-lore"></a>Spout Forbidden Lore

When you **consult your accumulated knowledge about a forbidden topic you have learned**, roll+Int. On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. On a 7–9, the GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it useful. Be careful, too much comfort with blasphemous knowledge can draw the eye of loyal servants of the Imperium.

### <a class="anchor-from-text" id="hatred"></a>Hatred

Your hatred for a particular enemy of the Imperium runs deep. Each time you take this move, select one of the groups below and describe how your hatred took root. Whenever you **deal damage against a hated enemy**, roll an extra damage die.

*   Xenos (choose a species)
*   Criminals
*   Daemons
*   Psykers
*   Mutants
*   Cultists
