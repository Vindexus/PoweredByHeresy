## Starting Moves

### Tactical Advantage

Each battle is different and requires a different approach. At the start of each battle, decide which tactic you are actively employing.

*   Defensive: As long as you don't attempt to gain ground, you gain +1 to all [Defy Danger](https://github.com/Vindexus/PoweredByHeresy/blob/master/game/github/basicmoves.md#defy-danger) rolls
*   Reactive: Whenever you are attacked, you can immediately respond and take +1 forward against your attacker
*   Reckless: You deal an extra damage die, but your defense is reduced by 1
*   Precise: While you remain focused on a single target, you inflict +1 wounds when you damage them

If you change tactics you lose the benefit of the one you had chosen.

### Armored

You ignore the Clumsy tag on any armor you wear.
