# Basic Moves

### Fire for Effect

When you **fire your ranged weapon to deal damage**, roll+BS and expend a use of your weapon. On a 10+ deal your damage. At your option you may expend another use of your weapon to add +1d4 damage. On a 7-9 you deal your damage and choose one:

*   You take what you can get, deal -1d6 damage
*   You need to take some more shots, expend another use of your weapon
*   You have to place yourself or a teammate in danger, the GM will tell you how

> Fire for Effect is your go-to move when a character is shooting to kill. It covers drawing, cocking, aiming, and shooting your weapon. Firing your weapon doesn't mean squeezing off a single shot, it means shooting for a few seconds. That can mean a single shot, or a whole flurry of them. Either way, it's a single use of the weapon. Leave the exact number of shots to the fiction and let the uses dictate when they run low.

> If you're using a weapon that doesn't have enough uses you can't take the bonus damage on the 10+ or the "expend another use" option on a 7-9.

### Hack and Slash

When you **attack an enemy in melee**, roll+WS. On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to roll an extra damage die but expose yourself to the enemyâ€™s attack. On a 7-9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.

### Defy Danger

When you act despite an imminent threat, describe how and roll. If you...

*   Use your strength of arms, roll+WS
*   Use a gun, roll+BS

On a 10+ you're good. On a 7-9 uh oh.
