## Starting Moves

### Tactical Advantage

Each battle is different and requires a different approach. At the start of each battle, decide which tactic you are actively employing.

*   Defensive: As long as you don't attempt to gain ground, you gain +1 to all Defy Danger rolls
*   Reactive: Whenever you are attacked, you can immediately respond and take +1 forward
*   Reckless: You deal +1d4 damage and take +1d4 damage
*   Precise: While you remain focused on a single target, you gain +2 piercing against them

If you change tactics you lose the benefit of the one you had chosen.

### Armored

You ignore the Clumsy tag on any armor you wear.
