# Damage and Wounds

This document is a work in progress. All numbers, and the entire system, are subject to change.

## Damage

*   Damage is given by people, environment, weapons, poison, etc
*   Damage is not guaranteed to inflict wounds
*   Whether damage inflicts a wound depends on your defense

## Wounds

*   A creature has a certain number of max wounds they can take before they die
*   A wound is significant damage, not just scrapes and bruises
*   Wounds can be healed, but can easily leave scars
*   reatures have Current Wounds and Max Wounds

## Defense

*   Your Defense is a number that represents your ability to withstand damage without suffering wounds
*   It’s a single tally that incorporates things like armor, reflexes, cover, shields, and even luck, or faith.
*   Your Defense can change from attack to attack based on your physical state, the type of attack, your surroundings, etc

## Dealing Damage and Inflicting Wounds

*   When you deal damage, you roll all the relevant dice of your weapon, as well as any bonus dice afforded to you from moves, equipment, or buffs
*   After you have rolled your dice, you may roll extra dice or reroll some dice based on special rules you have
*   Once you are done rolling, count all the dice that are higher than the Defense of your target
*   That number is how many wounds you inflict

## Taking Damage and Suffering Wounds

*   This works the same as Dealing and Inflicting but in reverse
*   Roll the dice for the damage you are receiving
*   Reroll any dice or extra dice as needed
*   Count the number of dice that are higher than your Defense
*   That number is how many wounds you suffer

## Example of Play

*   Griff shoots his shotgun at a cultist named Scar
*   Griff’s shotgun deals 2d6 damage and has the tag Proven (2)
*   Griff rolls his damage and gets a 1 and a 3
*   The Proven (2) tag lets Griff reroll any roll of 2 or lower, but not the reroll
*   Griff rerolls his 1 and gets a 5
*   Griff’s final result is a 5 and a 3
*   The cultist has a defense of 3
*   Griff causes 1 wound to Scar

## Example Wounds and Defense

A human with civilian clothes and no training or combat experience would have Max Wounds of 3 and Defense of 1

An Imperial Guardsman wearing Flak Armor would have Defense 3 and Max Wounds 3

An Adeptus Astartes with Power Armor would have Defense 6 and Max Wounds 8

## Dying

When your current wounds reaches or exceeds your max wounds, you are dying and roll for [Last Breath](https://github.com/Vindexus/PoweredByHeresy/blob/master/game/github/specialmoves.md#last-breath). Some dangers instantly have you roll for [Last Breath](https://github.com/Vindexus/PoweredByHeresy/blob/master/game/github/specialmoves.md#last-breath), completely bypassing damage and wounds.

## Improving Defense

Here are some things that can improve defense.

*   Flak Armor: +1 Defense
*   Good cover: +1 Defense against ranged attacks
*   Parry skill: +1 Defense against melee attacks
*   Power armor: +2 Defense
*   Adeptus power armor: +3 Defense
*   Uncanny reflexes: +1 Defense

## Healing Wounds

*   You can reduce your wounds by 1 or by getting medical attention
*   One day of rest will reduce your current wounds by 1
*   One day of rest under the care of a talented medical team will reduce your current wounds by 2
*   A medkit applied properly will heal 1 wound
