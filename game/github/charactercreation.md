# Character Creation

## Choose a Specialty

Look at the list of specialties and choose one that interests you. Your Inquisitor's retinue doesn't need two of the same type of class, so if two people want the same class talk it over like adults and compromise. Your character will be able to unlock new specialities as they level up.

> I want to look for clues and interrogate people, so I'll pick Investigator.

## Choose a Background

Your background describes what your character was doing before being recruited by your Inquisitor. It might not have been where your skills brought you to the attention of the Inquisitor, but it is likely. Once per session you may reroll a roll if you can describe how your background would have prepared you for this situation, using the This I Know special move.

### Adeptus Administratrum

Space nerds.

### Adeptus Arbites

Space cops.

### Adeptus Mechanicus

Space mechanics.

### Ecclesiarchy

Space priests.

### Imperial Guard

Space soldiers.

### Outcast

> I'd like to have a religious background as someone who grew up working in a Basilica. I'll choose Ecclesiarchy.
