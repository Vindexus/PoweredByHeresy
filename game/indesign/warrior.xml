<h2>Starting Moves</h2>
<move><h3>Tactical Advantage</h3>
<p>Each battle is different and requires a different approach. At the start of each battle, decide which tactic you are actively employing.</p>
<ul><li>Defensive: As long as you don't attempt to gain ground, you gain +1 to all Defy Danger rolls</li>
<li>Reactive: Whenever you are attacked, you can immediately respond and take +1 forward</li>
<li>Reckless: You deal +1d4 damage and take +1d4 damage</li>
<li>Precise: While you remain focused on a single target, you gain +2 piercing against them</li></ul>
<p>If you change tactics you lose the benefit of the one you had chosen.</p></move></Root>
