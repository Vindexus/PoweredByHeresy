<p>When <strong>you're dying</strong> you see the darkness cloud your vision as you drift into death. Describe what thoughts or prayers spur you on and roll (don't add any stats).</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+ you've defied the odds, and barely cling to life.</li>
<li>On a 7-9 you live, but your brush with death takes its toll. Describe the lasting effects your body or mind take and the GM will tell you which of your statistics you must reduce permanently by 1.</li>
<li>On a 6-, you join the seemingly endless stream of souls to have been lost under the rule of the Imperium.</li>
</ul></div></div></body></html>
