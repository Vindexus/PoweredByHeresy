<p>When you <strong>fire your ranged weapon to deal damage</strong>, roll+<abbr title="Ballistic Skill: How well you can shoot.">BS</abbr> and expend a use of your weapon. On a 10+ deal your damage. At your option you may expend another use of your weapon to add +1d4 damage. On a 7-9 you deal your damage and choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li>You take what you can get, deal -1d6 damage</li>
<li>You need to take some more shots, expend another use of your weapon</li>
<li>You have to place yourself or a teammate in danger, the GM will tell you how</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Fire for Effect is your go-to move when a character is shooting to kill. It covers drawing, cocking, aiming, and shooting your weapon. Firing your weapon doesn't mean squeezing off a single shot, it means shooting for a few seconds. That can mean a single shot, or a whole flurry of them. Either way, it's a single use of the weapon. Leave the exact number of shots to the fiction and let the uses dictate when they run low. </p><div class="br"></div>
  If you're using a weapon that doesn't have enough uses you can't take the bonus damage on the 10+ or the "expend another use" option on a 7-9.<p></p>

<p>When you <strong>attack an enemy in melee</strong>, roll+<abbr title="Weapon Skill: How well you can hit things.">WS</abbr>. On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to roll an extra damage die but expose yourself to the enemyâ€™s attack. On a 7-9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.</p></div><div class="move"><h3 id="defy-danger">Defy Danger</h3>
<p>When you act despite an imminent threat, describe how and roll. If you...</p>
<ul>

<li>Use a gun, roll+<abbr title="Ballistic Skill: How well you can shoot.">BS</abbr></li>
</ul>
<p>On a 10+ you're good. On a 7-9 uh oh.</p></div></div></body></html>
