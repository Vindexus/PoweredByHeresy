</nav><h1>Basic Moves</h1>
<div class="move"><h3>Hack and Slash</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you <strong>attack an enemy in melee</strong>, roll+<abbr title="Weapon Skill: How well you can hit things.">WS</abbr>. On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to roll an extra damage die but expose yourself to the enemy's attack. On a 7-9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.</p></div>
<div class="move-explanation"><p>The extra damage die you roll will be the largest size that you are already rolling. If your attack deals 1d8+1d6 damage, you would roll 2d8+1d6.</p></div>
</div><div class="move"><h3>Fire for Effect</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you <strong>fire your ranged weapon to deal damage</strong>, roll+<abbr title="Ballistic Skill: How well you can shoot.">BS</abbr> and expend a use of your weapon. On a 10+ deal your damage. At your option you may expend another use of your weapon to add an extra damage die. On a 7-9 you deal your damage and choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li>You take what you can get, you target gets +1 defense against this attack</li>
<li>You need to take some more shots, expend another use of your weapon</li>
<li>You have to place yourself or a teammate in danger, the GM will tell you how</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="move-explanation"><p>Fire for Effect is your go-to move when a character is shooting to kill. It covers drawing, cocking, aiming, and shooting your weapon. Firing your weapon doesn't mean squeezing off a single shot, it means shooting for a few seconds. That can mean a single shot, or a whole flurry of them. Either way, it's a single use of the weapon. Leave the exact number of shots to the fiction and let the uses dictate when they run low.</p>
<p>If you're using a weapon that doesn't have enough uses you can't take the bonus damage on the 10+ or the "expend another use" option on a 7-9.</p></div>
</div><div class="move"><h3>Reload</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you <strong>take a moment to reload your weapon</strong> reset your weapon's uses and expend 1 ammo.</p></div>
<div class="move-explanation"><p>Once a character has expended all the uses of their weapon they need to reload. This isn't assumed, the players have to explicitly say they take a moment to reload. How long it takes is up to the GM, and reloading certainly counts as a prime opportunity for a GM move.</p></div>
</div><div class="move"><h3>Suppressing Fire</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you <strong>fire a weapon at one or more targets to suppress them</strong>, roll+<abbr title="Ballistic Skill: How well you can shoot.">BS</abbr> and expend 1 use of your weapon. On a hit the target's morale is tested: they might dive for cover, falter, or attempt to flee. Your allies gain +1 forward against them. On a 10+ you also deal your damage.</p></div>
<div class="move-explanation"><p>If you're shooting at the enemy for almost any effect other than to hit something, you're likely using suppressing fire. You might still land a few shots, but what you're trying to do is keep heads down so your allies can take advantage.</p></div>
</div><div class="move"><h3>Throw Grenade</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you <strong>prime and throw a grenade</strong>, roll+<abbr title="Strength: How much you can bench press.">S</abbr>. On a 10+, the grenade lands where you aimed. On a 7-9 choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li>The grenade lands where you aimed but you have to move to make the throw placing you or someone else in danger as described by the GM</li>
<li>The grenade only lands near where you aimed, for a reduced or unexpected effect as described by the GM</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="move-explanation"><p>Pulling out a grenade and chucking it can all be done in one motion, but only if you have a grenade on hand. As a GM, the 7-9 results give you a lot of opportunity for interesting hard moves, don't be afraid to use them. A wily cultist might see an Acolyte fumbling for a grenade as a perfect opportunity to charge them. A grenade might fall short and deal half damage, or it might catch an ally in its blast. Explosives can also change the landscape of the battlefield by creating firewalls, caving in walls, making craters, or destroying cover.</p></div>
</div><div class="move"><h3>Defy Danger</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it</p>
<ul>
<li>by using skill in melee attacks, +<abbr title="Weapon Skill: How well you can hit things.">WS</abbr></li>
<li>by using skill with ranged weapons, +<abbr title="Ballistic Skill: How well you can shoot.">BS</abbr></li>
<li>by powering through, +<abbr title="Strength: How much you can bench press.">S</abbr></li>
<li>by getting out of the way or acting fast, +<abbr title="Agility: How quick you are.">Ag</abbr></li>
<li>by enduring, +<abbr title="Toughness: How much of a beating you can take.">T</abbr></li>
<li>with quick thinking, +<abbr title="Intelligence: How much you know, how smart you are.">Int</abbr></li>
<li>using charm and social grace, +<abbr title="Fellowship: How much people like you.">Fel</abbr></li>
<li>through mental fortitude, +<abbr title="Willpower: How strong your mind is.">WS</abbr></li>
<li>noticing something, +<abbr title="Perception: How much you notice things.">Per</abbr></li>
</ul>
<p>On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear. On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.</p></div>

</div><div class="move"><h3>Defend</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you <strong>stand in defense of a person, item, or location</strong> under attack, roll+<abbr title="Toughness: How much of a beating you can take.">T</abbr>. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. So long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself</li>
<li>Halve the attack's effect or wounds inflicted</li>
<li>Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker</li>
</ul></div>

</div><div class="move"><h3>Discern Realities</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you closely study a situation or person, roll+<abbr title="Perception: How much you notice things.">Per</abbr>. On a 10+, ask the GM 3 questions from the list below. On a 7–9, ask 1.</p>
<p>Either way, take +1 forward when acting on the answers.</p>
<ul>
<li>What happened here recently?</li>
<li>What is about to happen?</li>
<li>What should I be on the lookout for?</li>
<li>What here is useful or valuable to me?</li>
<li>Who’s really in control here?</li>
<li>What here is not what it appears to be?</li>
</ul></div>

</div><div class="move"><h3>Spout Common Lore</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you <strong>consult your accumulated knowledge about a non-forbidden topic</strong>, roll+<abbr title="Intelligence: How much you know, how smart you are.">Int</abbr>. On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. On a 7–9, the GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?” Tell them the truth, now.</p></div>

</div><div class="move"><h3>Basic Tech-Use</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you attempt to <strong>use an advanced piece of technology, or repair a simple piece,</strong> roll+<abbr title="Intelligence: How much you know, how smart you are.">Int</abbr>. On a 10+ you do what you set out to do and choose one. On a 7-9 the same, but choose two:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes longer than you'd planned</li>
<li>You have to cannibalize some equipment on hand, the GM will tell you what</li>
<li>You get a lesser result than you intended, the GM will tell you what</li>
</ul></div>

</div><div class="move"><h3>Aid or Interfere</h3>
<div class="move-description"><p>When you <strong>help or hinder someone</strong>, describe how and roll+bond with them. On a 10+ add +2 or -2 to  their roll, your choice. On a 7-9 add +1 or -1 to their roll, your choice, but you open yourself up to danger, retribution, or cost.</p></div>
