<h2 id="the-setting">The Setting</h2>
<p>It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor of Mankind has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind by force of will and master of a million worlds by the might of His inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the vast Imperium of Man for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day so that He may never truly die.Yet even in His deathless state, the Emperor continues His eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in His name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst His soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the Tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat to humanity from aliens, heretics, mutants -- and far, far worse. To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be relearned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.</p>

<h2 id="the-mission">The Mission</h2>
<p>Players play as members of the Inquisition, acolytes to an Inquisitor.</p>

<h2 id="the-game-as-a-conversation">The Game as a Conversation</h2>
<p>Powered by Heresy is played like a conversation at the table; somebody says something, then you reply, maybe someone else chimes in. We talk about the fiction-the world of the characters and the things that happen around them. As we ply, the rules chime in, too. They have something to say about the world. There are no turns or rounds in Powered by Heresy, no rules to say whose turn it is to talk. Instead players take turns in the natural flow of the conversation, which always has some back-and-forth. The GM says something, the players respond. The players ask questions or make statements, the GM tells them what happens next.</p>

<p>The rules help shape the conversation of play. While the GM and the players are talking, the rules and the fiction are talking, too. Every rule has an explicit fictional trigger that tells you when it is meant to come into the conversation.</p>

<p>Like any conversation, the time you spend listening is just as important as the time you spend talking. The details established by the other people at the table (the GM and the other players) are important to you: they might change what moves you can make, set up an opportunity for you, or create a challenge you have to face. The conversation works best when we all listen, ask questions, and build on each other’s contributions.</p>

<h2 id="making-moves">Making Moves</h2>
<p>The most basic unit of rules in Powered by Heresy is the move. A move looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you <strong>attack an enemy in melee</strong>, roll+<abbr title="Weapon Skill: How well you can hit things.">WS</abbr>. On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to roll an extra damage die but expose yourself to the enemy's attack. On a 7-9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Moves are rules that tell you when they trigger and what effect they have. A move depends on a fictional action and always has some fictional effect. “Fictional” means that the action and effect come from the world of the characters we’re describing. In the move above the trigger is “when you attack an enemy in melee.” The effect is what follows: a roll to be made and differing fictional effects based on the outcome of the roll.</p>

<p>When a player describes their character doing something that triggers a move, that move happens and its rules apply. If the move requires a roll, its description will tell you what dice to roll and how to read their results.</p>

<p>A character can’t take the fictional action that triggers a move without that move occurring. For example, if Isaac tells the GM that his character dashes past a crazed axe-wielding ganger to the open door, he makes the <a href="/basicmoves#defy-danger">Defy Danger</a> move because its trigger is “when you act despite an imminent threat.” Isaac can’t just describe his character running past the orc without making the <a href="/basicmoves#defy-danger">Defy Danger</a> move and he can’t make the <a href="/basicmoves#defy-danger">Defy Danger</a> without acting despite an imminent threat or suffering a calamity. The moves and the fiction go hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>Everyone at the table should listen for when moves apply. If it’s ever unclear if a move has been triggered, everyone should work together to clarify what’s happening. Ask questions of everyone involved until everyone sees the situation the same way and then roll the dice, or don’t, as the situation requires.</p>

<p>The GM’s enemies, NPCs, and other assorted heresies also have moves, but they work differently.</p>
