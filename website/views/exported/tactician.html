<li>Reactive: Whenever you are attacked, you can immediately respond and take <abbr title="The next time you roll a move, add +1 to your roll.">+1 forward</abbr> against your attacker</li>
<li>Reckless: You deal an extra damage die, but your <abbr title="The higher your defense, the less likely each damage die rolled against you will inflict a wound.">defense</abbr> is reduced by 1</li>
<li>Precise: While you remain focused on a single target, you inflict +1 wounds when you damage them</li>
