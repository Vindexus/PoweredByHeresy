<li>Reactive: Whenever you are attacked, you can immediately respond and take +1 forward</li>
<li>Reckless: You deal an extra damage die, but your defense is reduced by 1</li>
<li>Precise: While you remain focused on a single target, you inflict +1 wounds when you damage them</li>
</ul>
<p>If you change tactics you lose the benefit of the one you had chosen.</p></div>
