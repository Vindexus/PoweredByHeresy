# About this Project
PbH is an open source game. These docs are a work in progress.

## The Big Three
Read about the 3 questions in [this blog post](https://stockade.wordpress.com/2009/09/28/the-3-questions-1/). They aren't meant to be questions whose answers you can turn to when unsure about changes you want to add.

### What is the game about?
Exploring a specific region of the Warhammer 40,000 universe in your search for heresy, and wiping it out when you find it.

### How does your game do this?

### How does your game encourage/reward this?

## Goals
Here are some goals I'm spitballing.

 - Crunchier than Dungeon World
 - Less crunchy than Dark Heresy
 - Health should matter more than Dungeon World
 - Very modular. Easy to add in supplements of new enemies, 
 - Investigative. Finding clues is important.
 - Build the sector. The GM and the players should find out about the cultures of the places they visit as they play, together.
