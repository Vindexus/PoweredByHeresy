# About this Project
These are the documents for those interested in helping with writing the game and its codebase.

## How It Works
The game is a combination of game text and NodeJS code. Game text is written, then run through compilers, and outputs readable files.

## How To Help

### 1. Making Small Changes
You can make small text changes directly on GitHub by editing files in the [source folder](https://github.com/Vindexus/PoweredByHeresy/tree/master/source). Here's what's in there

 - [Pages](https://github.com/Vindexus/PoweredByHeresy/tree/master/source/pages): Game text is in these pages, and they reference game data.
 - [Data](https://github.com/Vindexus/PoweredByHeresy/tree/master/source/data): Little pieces of game data, like moves and items, are stored here to be inserted into the pages.
 - [Partials](https://github.com/Vindexus/PoweredByHeresy/tree/master/source/partials): Small templates for things in pages that crop up a lot, like moves.

### 2. Making Large Changes
If you want to make large changes, you'll probably need to get the entire project with its code up and running locally.

### 3. Making Code Changes
The project's compilers are based on two NodeJS modules that I'll add links to later.
